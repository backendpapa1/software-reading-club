### Goal
My goal for reading this book is to deepen my understanding of the open-source XMPP server, Ejabberd, which is built using Erlang. By gaining a thorough knowledge of Ejabberd, I aim to:

- Create custom extensions.
- Understand its internal architecture.
- Explore its various capabilities.
- Interestingly, WhatsApp utilizes a customized version of Ejabberd to power its chat system. This inspires me to move beyond the common focus on WebSocket-based implementations and instead leverage Ejabberd's robust and proven infrastructure.
